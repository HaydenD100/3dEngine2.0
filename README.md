# OpenGL Engine 2.0

### 3D Engine 2.0 2024/July/04
This week I have implemented phyiscs, my implementation includes rigidbodies and axis alined boxes for collision, GameObjects can be used to produce a collider with the same demensions as the model. A Map editor is also in the works making it easier for 
me to edit the scenes, you can also save gameobjects in the scene to json files and load them through the Asset Manager. The Player was changed to work with the new physics system and the movement has been changed to add inertia making the movement more "realistic".


### 3D Engine 2.0 2024/June/30
This is a full rewrite of my first 3D OpenGL engine, the first engine succumbed to poorly written spaghetti code from when I was first learning OpenGl. This Engine has been more thoroughly thought out and will hopefully
allow me to make a simple FPS shooter game. So far the Engine has basic Rendering and Text Rendering, Basic Lighting, Scene Managment, Input Managment, Asset Managment. The next step for the engine is basic Physics and Audio which.
