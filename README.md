# 3D Engine 2.0 2024/June/28
This is a full rewrite of my first 3D OpenGL engine, the first engine succumbed to poorly written spaghetti code from when I was first learning OpenGl. This Engine has been more thought out and will hopefully
allow me to make a simple FPS shooter game. So far the Engine has basic Rendering and Text Eendering, Basic Lighting, Scene Managment, Input Managment, Asset Managment. The next step for the engine is basic Physics and Audio whic.
